## Teacher Philosophy
The grandest challenge that a university can aspire to is the creation of transformative educational experiences.  Such experiences are by nature a conversion process, where students, faculty, and the institution engage in a conversation that transforms each party irrevocably and collectively calls us to a higher vision of ourselves as individuals and a community.

## Student Works & Projects
GIMM Students are constantly being pushed to create unique and helpful apps, experiences, and therapeutic tools. These works are often used for student portfolios. On occasion, if a student’s work is compelling, the GIMM program may present the solution at a fair or convention. Students seldom work on projects purely for artistic value.
