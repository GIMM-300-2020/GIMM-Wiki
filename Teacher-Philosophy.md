# GIMM Teacher Philosophy
## By Joey Rowell
Ellertson:
The grandest challenge that a university can aspire to is the creation of transformative educational experiences.  Such experiences are by nature a conversion process, where students, faculty, and the institution engage in a conversation that transforms each party irrevocably and collectively calls us to a higher vision of ourselves as individuals and a community.  If done right, it will lead us to see that we are not our research, our scholarship or even our disciplines, and that our purpose is not transactional credentialing but rather transformative growth.  At this juncture in our history, with a culture that is fractured and conflicted with itself, we contend that any higher vision for what we can be must put community at the center of our effort.  We must now strive to rediscover ourselves. We must see our research efforts not as an exercise in the generation of profit or prestige, but rather as an opportunity to show our students, our faculty, and our community that we live for the benefit of each other.

Dan:
GIMM is based on a philosophically different emphasis on academic values than traditional departments.  While mastery of fundamentals and fluency with higher order concepts within a discipline is still a value of GIMM, this department prioritizes developing interdisciplinary skills and social problem solving thinking in students.  We aim to give back to the broader social community and not just further the goals of an ever isolated academic environment, and to do so we teach our students to use philosophical reasoning, narrative creativity, communicative and cooperative leadership, and artistic vision in conjunction with digital media manipulation abilities, graphic design, animation, and modeling skills, and cutting edge computer science to solve problems for the community and enhance the lives of the individuals.  Our philosophy asks us to reach across arbitrary department divisions in our university and between our university and the society that enables it to exist and forge new connections, novel solutions, and creative problem solving for real community concerns.
