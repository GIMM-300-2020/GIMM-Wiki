# Student Philosophy

#### GIMM: Studentâ€™s Perspective on Program Philosophy:

The Boise State University GIMM (Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile technology) major has a dedicated philosophy that revolves around hands on learning. The program aims to enable students to build a functional portfolio that demonstrates their ability to learn and develop new skills. This portfolio is made up of games, art pieces, websites, apps, and more. Unlike most majors, the GIMM major recognizes the job markets need for experience and provides students with artifacts that can be used to demonstrate learning.

The foundation of Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile technology is the interaction between the creators and the users. Upon entry to the GIMM program, the student is given a lecture from the head of the department, Dr. Anthony Ellertson. This speech includes a philosophical demonstration of serious games. The average student enters the program with an understanding of games that induce escapism, however, it is the goal philosophical goal of the major to understand how the interactive media medium can help people in a real and impactful way. Our program touts its most successful serious game to date, a Virtual Reality game designed to help medical students practice the insertion of a catheter. This tool is significantly cheaper than medical dummies and additionally simulates some of the infection dangers of the procedure. The point of this simulator is to assist people, and thus enforces the serious games aspect of the GIMM philosophy.
