# Expectations and Path to Success
GIMM (Games Interactive Mobile Media), is a program centered around the development process for games and applications for all devices. Similar to the industry, each year new techniques and tools are introduced to keep students as up to date as possible. Because of this, students may be afraid of what they are getting into, which is where this page comes in. Here you can prepare for what expectations and tips for how to succeed.

For additional help,  an appointment can be made with an Advisor to review current requirements and go over any questions.

## Student Expectations
While GIMM covers many complex content creation tools and topics, the program from the start is built for beginners. This was purposefully done to not exclude anyone from the program due to lack of prior experience. The first courses will introduce basic coding theory, animation, and code structure.

The program is a little unique in the fact that it doesn’t actively use tests to gauge a student’s progress in keeping up with the material. Instead they show the development of their skills at project deadlines when they present to professors and other classmates. The students have regular meetings with professors to seek out advice and assistance when needed.
Students will be expected to be able to form groups and work on multiple group projects throughout the course of the semesters. Students will have to learn how to communicate effectively in order to complete projects on time. It is encouraged early on to develop time management skills as late work is not accepted without serious cause.

As students advance through the program, they are expected to take the skills they learn and apply it to every new task they are given. Students will build up a portfolio throughout their career in GIMM. The portfolio is a fundamental aspect of GIMM that is crucial for a student’s success after graduation.

Some examples of group assignments will be:
- Group game
- Short animation
- App for phone or computer use
- Websites
- VR and AR
