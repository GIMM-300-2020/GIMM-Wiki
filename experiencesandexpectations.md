# Expectations and Path to Success
GIMM (Games Interactive Mobile Media), is a program centered around the development process for games and applications for all devices. Similar to the industry, each year new techniques and tools are introduced to keep students as up to date as possible. Because of this, students may be afraid of what they are getting into, which is where this page comes in. Here you can prepare for what expectations and tips for how to succeed.

For additional help, an [appointment](https://square.site/book/G5BSV847WAG3G/ci-d-boise-id) can be made with an Advisor to review current requirements and go over any questions.

## Student Expectations
While GIMM covers many complex content creation tools and topics, the program from the start is built for beginners. This was purposefully done to not exclude anyone from the program due to lack of prior experience. The first courses will introduce basic coding theory, animation, and code structure.

The program is a little unique in the fact that it doesn’t actively use tests to gauge a student’s progress in keeping up with the material. Instead they show the development of their skills at project deadlines when they present to professors and other classmates. The students have regular meetings with professors to seek out advice and assistance when needed.
Students will be expected to be able to form groups and work on multiple group projects throughout the course of the semesters. Students will have to learn how to communicate effectively in order to complete projects on time. It is encouraged early on to develop time management skills as late work is not accepted without serious cause.

As students advance through the program, they are expected to take the skills they learn and apply it to every new task they are given. Students will build up a portfolio throughout their career in GIMM. The portfolio is a fundamental aspect of GIMM that is crucial for a student’s success after graduation.

Some examples of group assignments will be:
- Group game
- Short animation
- App for phone or computer use
- Websites
- VR and AR

## How to Succeed
GIMM requires high levels of time management and ability to work coherently in groups of 3 or more people. In order to succeed, one must have many skill levels including but not limited to:
- Time Management - Being able to accomplish all of your tasks as well as personal tasks without bringing down your team. Most weeks you will be getting more than 10 hours of homework per class, so being able to juggle personal life, school, and work is necessary to succeed.

- Social Skills - Must be able to work alongside others without miscommunication and be able to communicate with them throughout the projects. Any of the fields you can go into from GIMM require workers to be in groups, so being able to work not only in a group, but communicate with peers when stuck or to help is a huge skill that you need.
- Knowing your limits - every student coming into GIMM has their own set of skills or lack thereof. No one is expected to know everything, but everyone does have something to offer. Knowing where you stand it crucial to understanding what you need to learn and where you can be most helpful to others.

- No Equipment Needed! - for the first few years, personal equipment is not necessary. Once you start getting into later years, a gaming laptop and VR rig may be needed in order to work on projects from home, but everything else is provided at school for everyone to use.


This may sound scary to someone outside of the workflow that GIMM requires. Not to worry though, there are steps one can take to familiarize themselves and adjust properly.

1. Show up to the open Lab on Fridays. GIMM students don’t generally have classes scheduled on Fridays, this is to ensure that students have time to work on projects and get assignments done using the equipment available to them. 
 
2. Go to all your classes. When first going to school it can be tempting to skip classes as it’s your first time on your own with a lot of freedom. Or maybe you think you know a lot and are over prepared for that one class. There is more than just class you will miss out by not attending.
 
3. Give yourself plenty of time to finish assignments. Being diligent with your time can be the difference between success and failure in your classes.
 
4. Take notes and pay attention during lectures. Students are advised to keep a flash drive on them at all times to keep copies of lectures and notes during class.
 
5. Get plenty of sleep. The projects in GIMM require a lot of time to complete, for this reason it is important not to crunch everything in one go, as it can hinder your learning and lead to sloppy work.

All in all, when it comes down to it, success is up to you. GIMM is about failure, and learning from it, so in order to succeed you need to be okay with failing a few times. If you can do that and all the rest, you will make it through easily.
