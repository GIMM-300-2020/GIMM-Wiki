After having Dr. Dan as a student, Dr. Ellertson offered him a job teaching for GIMM and explained his vision for the program as a catalyst and model for the university system. Dr. Dan began designing the advanced upper level development classes so that GIMM students would have the ability to program cross platform websites, games, and apps using multiplayer networking, VR and AR integration, and advanced machine learning techniques for AI. He developed four new classes for the GIMM program that taught python, C#, javascript, and typescript advanced programming concepts including design patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span class="text-small"><strong>Background</strong></span></h2><p><i>Dr. Dan was born and raised in a variety of places.
