<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Object Oriented Programming:</u></p><p>Most of the code-related projects done in GIMM are created using the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) technique. This is a computer programming method that allows developers to create different classes, or “objects”, that can interact but have independent functionality. Objects are instances of a class that can be viewed as variables that are able to store data as well as complex systems. This technique allows programmers to make edits and additions to pieces of the code without it impacting other classes of the code as long as you adhere to the main principles of OOP.</p><p><u>Class:</u></p><p>In object-oriented programming, a category of objects. For example, there might be a <i>class</i> called shape that contains objects which are circles, rectangles, and triangles. The <i>class</i> defines all the common properties of the different objects that belong to it.</p><p><u>Object:</u></p><p>Generally, any item that can be individually selected and manipulated. This can include shapes and pictures that appear on a display screen as well as less tangible software entities. In object-oriented programming, for example, an object is a self-contained entity that consists of both data and procedures to manipulate the data.</p><p><u>Pattern:</u></p><p>The term pattern relates to the use of patterns in architecture. A pattern is the formalization of a problem/solution pair, used to make an object-oriented design decision. The purpose of a pattern is to codify existing design knowledge so that developers are not constantly reinventing the wheel. Also, by naming these patterns, it eases communication among developers. The term pattern was first coined by Christopher Alexander et al. in 1977. * [Source: Patterns in Object-Oriented Development]</p><figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:19.48%;"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4s0G7uBlFCs_57GBW6ceKi0pp9NlO_fxRn7sKYfIv7btGcmdjFkFI7_GWHtnUxbDwRRPy6CS5AC22E1d5nvWSxayLjLIRtAQfZICQPb16vP9A0rIM5sxKM707WsuGZOdvmU67O4"><figcaption>Using encapsulation, the public functions are able to access the Mouse's private variables</figcaption></figure><p><u>Encapsulation:</u></p><p>Encapsulation is ensuring that the information stored within a class is kept private and is accessed indirectly through public methods. Figure # shows this with the “Mouse class” which has private variables that can’t be accessed by the cat or cheese objects. However, there are public functions that allow these variables to still be altered by the interaction.</p><p><u>Abstraction:</u></p><p>An abstraction is a concept or method that isn’t associated with any particular instance of an object. A fundamental property of abstraction is that a class does not need to know the details of another class, only the interface of the class.</p><figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-left" style="width:27.37%;"><img src="/enemycode.png"></figure><p><u>Inheritance:</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Inheritance is used when you have several classes that all need to have similar methods and data stored within them. This concept allows for a programmer to make a “parent” class that will have all the data that is needed in every “child” class. These children are then able to add more functionality beyond what is defined by the parent.</p><p><u>Polymorphism:</u></p><figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-left" style="width:26.92%;"><img src="/enemytype.png"><figcaption><span class="text-small">This Enemy_1 is a an Enemy class object and overrides the Move() function of the base enemy.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Polymorphism is similar to inheritance with the main difference being instead of purely inheriting the values of the parent class, with polymorphism a child will override the functionality of the parent class. This allows for many objects that all have similar variables and functions, but some are able to be changed drastically, such as the Enemy class defined in figure # has a basic Move() function that is overridden for any instance of Enemy_1.</p><p><u>Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming:</u></p><p>One of the principal advantages of object-oriented programming techniques over procedural programming techniques is that they enable programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when a new type of object is added. A programmer can simply create a new object that inherits many of its features from existing objects. This makes object-oriented programs easier to modify.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Other Types of code learned through the GIMM program:</u></p><p>Action script - Action script is a coding language most commonly associated with Flash. It’s basically a simpler version of C#. Most, if not all, Flash programs are 2D. Unfortunately, Flash as a web service will soon be filtered out of most web browsers by the end of the year 2020. Though, Flash and Action Script remain to be great animation tools and a great start for beginner programmers.</p><figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:13.98%;"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dOx3JsqL-ZcTvotlUpF3fsNicpoT99o7QYAqCw7qnbGTzjZexKEgqE5o28wOsuKwoB3QCPfMd5qvTdEwLhsdUFf-nxHbs03z6H7MSOGnRPUwM4yzWg6levBpBHDUYA"></figure><p>Javascript &amp; Bootstrap - Javascript is the coding language used most commonly for web pages. Javascript is a very similar language to C# using a lot of the same terminology for a lot of the code. For example, doing functions and “if’ statements or declaring variables and strings are done in the same way for both languages. Bootstrap is an open source CSS that you can integrate into web pages to make them look more appealing. It also comes with several prebuilt functionalities to help making a website from scratch a lot easier.&nbsp;</p><p>ChucK - ChucK is a digital audio based programming language. ChucK plays off of C# but introduces a few new things that makes creating sounds and music interesting. With ChucK, you can generate totally new sounds, or use samples and tweek with them such as slowing them down, speeding them, changing their pitch, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Arduino - Arduinos are small computers that interact with the physical world in some way. There are many different types of Arduinos and they all are made to perform different tasks. Some Arduinos are made to send out bluetooth signals, some are made for music, and the list goes on. In GIMM, we learn how to code and assemble these little pieces of equipment to complete different tasks. Some of these tasks include turning on lights, creating moving pieces for a board game, and even a usable joystick for our own games.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Sources:</u></p><p>Bridger’s:</p><p><a href="https://www.oodesign.com/"><u>https://www.oodesign.com/</u></a></p><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/"><u>https://stackoverflow.com/</u></a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@cancerian0684/what-are-four-basic-principles-of-object-oriented-programming-645af8b43727"><u>https://medium.com/@cancerian0684/what-are-four-basic-principles-of-object-oriented-programming-645af8b43727</u></a></p><p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/"><u>https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/</u></a></p><p>Austin’s:</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4520411/adobe-flash-end-of-support"><u>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4520411/adobe-flash-end-of-support</u></a></p><p><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/"><u>https://www.arduino.cc/</u></a></p><p>Josh’s:</p><p><a href="https://www.webopedia.com/Programming/Object_Oriented_Programming"><u>https://www.webopedia.com/Programming/Object_Oriented_Programming</u></a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_(computer_science)"><u>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_(computer_science)</u></a></p>
