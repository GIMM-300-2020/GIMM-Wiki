# GIMM Works
GIMM Works is a student development team at Boise State University. They work with clients to create projects that solve real-world problems and benefit the community. The team has made projects that address eating disorders, help improve the literacy of deaf students, and aid those with spectrum disorders. Future projects will focus on addressing dementia and alzeihemers. Below are just a few examples of some of the extraordinary projects they have worked on.

## Projects

### ABC Go
Another project is the development of an app that teaches children to write. It utilizes augmented reality to track and model student progress. Aimed toward educators and parents, especially for children with developmental delays or on the autism spectrum, the app, once completed, is intended for phone and tablet use.

### Boise Airport Tour
A unique project GIMM is also currently involved in will help children with sensory issues navigate the airport. With the growing need for virtual learning and virtual therapy, GIMM hopes to develop a program that will allow its users to experience what it is like to board a plane for the first time. It will help them become more familiar with the airport and their newly found environment.

### Bronco BEAM
One further project at Boise State’s GIMM major is Bronco BEAM, an app created by the GIMM Works Dev Team to curtail food waste as well as solve campus hunger. Food insecurity, as a top crisis at the university, affects 40% of BSU students. The Bronco BEAM app directs students to catered campus events as they end, so that they may take leftover servings for themselves.

### Catheter Training Simulation
Another one of the many areas GIMM is actively involved in is the medical field. GIMM is currently aiming to innovate the current proper training of catheter insertion, which is a current rising problem. Rather than reusing or spending money to buy expensive mannequins, GIMM is looking to create a new cutting edge virtual reality catheter program. A program that will help students develop muscle memory during the proper procedure.

### David Virtual Reality Marble Sculpting
This project was developed for the “World Museum”, a space dedicated to delivering educational VR and AR art experiences that is housed in the Fine Arts Building on Boise State University’s campus. It is part of an installation that will also include a VR Sistine Chapel Fresco Art Experience and an AR Fresco Tutorial. 

The simulation allows users to pick up sculpting tools and carve out Michelangelo’s famous sculpture of David. The purpose of the simulation is to guide users through the motions, techniques, and history of sculpting.

### James Castle House
The team was asked by the city of Boise to build a virtual reality simulation of the shed where Idaho artist James Castle lived and worked. The 120 year-old shed is extremely fragile and undergoing conservation that makes it inaccessible to visitors for an extended period of time, but it’s an important artifact in Castle’s history.

The VR experience allows visitors to view the interior of the space where Castle created a lot of his work. Because few photos of Castle’s house exist, students referenced many of Castle’s drawings in order to create an accurate representation of the shed as it appeared during his time. Viewers can see Castle’s desk and bed, as well as the wood stove that once heated the space; they can even interact with some of the virtual objects in the display, such as pencils, a jar of soot, and a heart-shaped box.
