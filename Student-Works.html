<h1>Student Works</h1><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The GIMM program at BSU has produced many works. These works are geared toward solving issues in the world. Very seldomly are projects worked on purely for their creative value. These works are designed to improve the well being of others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Virtual Reality</h2><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The GIMM program hosts a variety of Virtual Reality (VR) experiences. VR is used to better submerge the audience and present an educational, therapeutic, or medical experience. One of these applications provides a therapeutic experience for those who have or are suffering from an eating disorder[<a href="#references">1</a>]. The ability to put someone in a specially curated environment will allow for in depth education, training simulation, socialization, therapy and more.</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:26.68%;"><img src="/disorder.png"><figcaption>Public presentation of "It's Not Me"</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Augmented Reality</h2><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Augmented Reality (AR) provides an overlay on top of reality itself, such as Snapchat filters. The GIMM program has produced several AR experiences designed to help children with special needs, locate graphite from geological maps, and even help with kindergarten preparedness[<a href="#references">2</a>]. AR is being used in the GIMM program to better integrate handheld technology into tools used by therapists, scientists, and medical experts. The nature of AR is not limited to large and expensive equipment and can be produced on modern handsets. The availability of these tools will provide experts quick and easy solutions to expensive alternatives.</p><figure class="image"><img src="/capture.png"><figcaption>Student presenting an AR App</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Medical</h2><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Boise State GIMM Program has made several utilities designed to help medical experts and professions. One of the main works from GIMM that demonstrates the usefulness of such tools was a training tool for nurses and doctors. The software provided an environment similar to one that users would expect in their field of work. It provides several training spaces that allow users to practice without the use of limited and expensive tools.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/W2rh5LV21_kQVZJzpiYPjiyMqESrJwOutcac2gyXdKsmxS8p7LRpUA6tCeB8XWO3QmXrGWthwYQMStVzOicPCXlDJhE4PxghoT4EEgnNZ-_NHWxfvk91NK0SD-X4NhcNMTmGhhYl"><figcaption>Medical Training for VR</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Therapy</h2><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Works from the GIMM program are targeted towards solving problems. One of these problems is the availability of therapeutic tools. Several works have been designed to help those recovering from disorders. These works include learning tools for special needs and relaxing experiences for those recovering from Chemotherapy[4].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:72.59%;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rNzeExoycEkprCtCfx5Io6iGM9LmPjLRDhB-8WYDyfC4e0RXP1w4YooKnHmkU4Gdm0AEO6SJ6IOk2mpSLynYexFPy181rjiHcjsNRbjvVxqpckBYVKDxjyjvnCb1ZcAkkiZg8zIM"><figcaption>A VR Experience for patients undergoing Chemotherapy</figcaption></figure><h2>Animation</h2><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GIMM Students do not always create interactive experiences. The program also has students creating animations and art to improve story boarding and storytelling. Though there are few publicly available animations created by GIMM students, nearly every student has been exposed to the technology and basic understanding of animation in their classes and they have all created their own small videos. Below is a small glimpse of one of them:</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:68.94%;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lNwK1CO6G5ao38Hygt01GU8Nyi8rdzQF_NrKmAN1eE4WDH-QjTE8b_ZxLWEDEfuooqXUhAd3NwTiYI_dG1U6gbRYPKlISAQFENYfWybPlM2URFy5nCKR35iokBsOMMfvmeHH9QLF"><figcaption>A GIMM Animation</figcaption></figure><p>The image below is the title of a music video that was animated by students in the GIMM program. The video can be found here: <a href="https://youtu.be/UfuSkpa6TiA">https://youtu.be/UfuSkpa6TiA</a>. The music was performed by the local Boise band “Evil-Liza.” The animation in the video depicts a post-apocalyptic world in which humans have created humanoid robots whose sole purpose is to measure how much pain and despair an individual can endure.</p><figure class="image"><img src="/screenshot_(282).png"></figure><h3>References</h3><ol><li>Misty Inglet (February 22, 2019). <a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/tech/boise-state-students-build-virtual-reality-programs-to-help-encourage-social-change/277-b04d7d8f-00a7-4ec0-bd0c-7a1e3901076e">"Boise State students build virtual reality programs to help encourage social change"</a></li><li>Natalie Hurst (February 8, 2017). <a href="https://idahonews.com/news/local/gaming-interactive-media-and-mobile-technology-at-bsu-more-than-just-games">"Gaming, Interactive Media and Mobile Technology at BSU: More than just games"</a></li><li>Jessica Taylor (July 22, 2019). <a href="https://www.kivitv.com/news/virtual-reality-experience-helps-patients-undergoing-chemotherapy-dialysis">"Virtual reality experience helps patients undergoing chemotherapy, dialysis"</a></li></ol>
