# Class Descriptions and Skills
## GIMM Courses
**Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile (GIMM)** features numerous upper division and lower division courses that teach students the necessary skills and applications to succeed in industries such as Mobile app development,Web development, and Video game development. The major outlines a course sequence and required classes list, detailing the order in which it is recommended that students undertake their courses, and what classes are required for a student to graduate. Students will acquire the necessary skills to create a digital portfolio which will showcase the various artifacts they have created.
## Lower Division Courses 
In the lower division courses of the GIMM program, students learn foundational skills of development seen often in Mobile app development, Web development, and Video game development industry. The program also covers multiple departments ranging from programming, digital art, and audio design. 
#### GIMM 100 Digital Tools for Interactivity 
An introduction to the creative process across artistic media and genres. A variety of expressive mediums are introduced to students to provide them with theoretical backgrounds in the production and choice of media. At the end of the course, students will e be familiar with common industry practices such as story-boarding and team coordination for interactive projects. They will also be introduced to common visual editing software such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. The software will allow students to create artistic pieces such as digital paintings, logos, concept art, and animations.
####  GIMM 110 Interactive Programming 
An introduction to the object-oriented programming paradigm for client-side interface development. Work with class objects, properties, abstraction, aggregation, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism inside of an OOP language. Also be introduced to selected OOP design patterns to help them understand how complex programming projects are planned and executed. With the use of Adobe software students will create basic game applications.
#### GIMM 200 Visual Storytelling
Focuses on the development of 2 & 3D models for game design. Be introduced to advanced image creation techniques in both 2 & 3D environments. Master environment and character creation techniques using industry standard tools. Similar to GIMM 100 Digital Tools of Interactivity, students will be using primarily adobe software in order to create artistic works.
#### GIMM 250 Interactive Storytelling
Focuses on the affordances of media and their use in interactive environments. Study narrative, 2D animation, and OOP programming to better understand how to create immersive experiences in mobile applications, graphic displays, and games. At the end of the course be familiar with 2D animation techniques, OOP programming principles, programming frameworks, interactive and streaming video, media theory and interactive storytelling. Students will also learn to bring these skills together to learn how to work as a group similar to the industry.
#### GIMM 270 Interactive Audio & Video 
Focuses on the creation of interactive sound and video artifacts. Be introduced to basic sound and video editing techniques and industry standard software. Also explore how to combine their video and sound editing skills with programming to create interactive media objects capable of containing metadata for info-graphics, hyperlinked video, and advanced green screen effects. 
#### GIMM 280 Interactive Physical Computing
GIMM 280 Interactive Physical Computing Focuses on concepts of circuits, sensors, and wireless networks as they relate to custom mobile device creation. Work with open source systems such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Zigbee to understand and create unique devices to fit specific mobile computing needs. 
#### GIMM 290 Interactive Storytelling
GIMM 290 Game Design Theory Focuses on the creation, design, and theory of games for console, mobile, and web environments. Study current and popular games to understand how culture and technology influence the design of games and learning simulations. Become familiar with industry practices in relation to project management for games and interactive simulations. Also be introduced to techniques in photo editing, illustration, and video editing for the creation of visual experiences in interactive environments. From a mixture of paper prototypes to experience with unity students at the end of course will grasp the ideas of learning how to narrow ideas and turn those creative ideas into a reality.
## Upper Division Courses
When the students complete the lower division courses, they move to the higher division courses in which students develop a personal virtual reality game, and work with clients in the industry in groups to create an app or other virtual environments.
#### GIMM 300 Mobile Web Development
This course focuses on the design, programming, and content management behind web-development. Students learn coding languages such as HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, XML, and jQuery. Client-side programming is used to create websites by incorporating AWS, remote servers, Bootstrap, WordPress and more. 
#### GIMM 310 Mobile Application Development for Media
Designing and developing mobile applications is the main focus of this course. These applications are designed for learning and branded user experiences. This course introduces students to the multitude of standard industry practices such as cross platform development environments. Students learn visual design practices, object orientated programming, streaming media for mobile networks as well as theories behind the mobile user experience. 
#### GIMM 330 3D Animation and Modeling
In this course, students learn the skills of 3D modeling and animation for video games and simulated environments. Using industry standard tools such as Blender and Maya, students implement design principles such as scale, proportion, 3D composition, color and more.
#### GIMM 350 Game Development
This course focuses on the development of 2D and 3D games, as well as learning simulations in both mobile and web environments. This course uses artificial intelligence engines, advanced physics 
#### GIMM 360 Game and Virtual Reality Audio
Students learn techniques to create interactive audio for video games and virtual reality projects. Integrating audio in game engines, virtual spatial audio environments, program interactive sound generation foley and sound design are the focuses of this course.
#### GIMM 370 Usability and E Commerce
In this course, students learn the principles of usability in Web, Mobile, and many other interactive media. With the optimal user experience in mind, students learn the best practices and techniques for strategies in marketing to the online audience.
#### GIMM 400 Advanced Topics
This course focuses on new trends and the possibilities within mobile and game development technologies. Kinect cameras, Wii Balance Boards, smart TVS and more are just some of the devices that students are exposed to within this course. Other topics that students will experience are augmented reality, advanced location-based services, and near field communications. Students will have the opportunity to create custom devices with Arduino circuit boards, Zigbee wireless networks and other types of sensors. Students will learn how to create multiple devices to meet user needs.
#### GIMM 440 Digital Portfolio
Students learn how to develop, refine, and present a professional portfolio that is based on their work. This course prepares students for the job market.
#### GIMM 480 Senior Capstone One / GIMM 490 Senior Capstone Two
In this two-part course, senior students will work with clients on advanced projects to support the research on campus and other non-profit efforts within the community. This course focuses on project management and team building skills, to prepare them for the industry.
