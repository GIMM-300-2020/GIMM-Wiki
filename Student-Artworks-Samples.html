<h1><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">GIMM Artwork</span></h1><h2><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">By Cole Rene</span></h2><h6><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Animation and design are vital part of the GIMM program at Boise State. Students will learn multiple skills throughout the program that they will take with them after graduation. Students who gradate with a GIMM degree will be qualified for multiple professions in the rapidly expanding job market.</span></h6><p><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>GIMM 100</strong>: In this class the student will learn how to use software such as Adobe After Effects and Adobe Animate, both of which are good tools to assist the student with their artwork and animation. The students will get the chance to learn effective story boarding as well as being introduced into group collaboration.The first project in this class teaches you the basics of animation and rotoscoping with Adobe Animate. The second project teaches you how to use Adobe After Effects by creating a title animation..&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>GIMM 200</strong>: In this class the student will complete their first big project. This project is not limited to a single software, the student is allowed to choose the software that they feel most comfortable with to complete the project. In this project, the student must complete a full 30 second animation of their choice. The student also completes a smaller project in this class where they learn the basics of Adobe Photoshop.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>GIMM 250</strong>: </span>Students will have two main projects in this class: an interactive comic and an interactive animation, both of which are done in groups. The interactive animation will have students focus more on their level design and character creation capability rather than their animation capabilities. This project will also include coding to complete the project. The interactive comic will also have students focus on their character creation and design as well as their storytelling capabilities.</p><p><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>GIMM 270</strong>: In this class the student will explore more in-depth into the software that was used in previous classes. They will do multiple smaller projects using Adobe Premiere Pro, such as learning how to use and work with green screens effectively and creating their own project with a green screen. They will also create a mock game trailer using Adobe Premiere Pro for the game that they made in their previous GIMM classes.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>GIMM 330</strong>: By the time students get to this class the students will be somewhat familiar with working in 3D worlds and working in a 3D space with the work that was done with Unity in GIMM 290. They will further improve their 3D design abilities by learning software such as Maya and Blender and completing projects that teach them 3D modeling and animation.</span></p>
